# üì© SMS Spam Detection using NLP

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classic Machine Learning techniques to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam).

---

## üîç Features

- ‚úÖ Text cleaning and preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing
  - Punctuation removal
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming (Porter Stemmer)
- üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- üß† Feature Extraction:
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency)
- ü§ñ Model Training:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
- üìà Model Evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains thousands of SMS messages labeled as **spam** or **ham**. Each message is a labeled text entry used for training and evaluating the models.

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-nlp.git
   cd sms-spam-nlp
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open and run the Colab Notebook**

   ```
   SMS Spam Detection Analysis - NLP.ipynb
   ```

> Alternatively, run it locally using Jupyter Notebook.

## üìå Result

Achieved **high accuracy** in detecting spam messages using NLP-based text preprocessing and traditional ML models like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
